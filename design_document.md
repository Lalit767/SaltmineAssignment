# Design and Architecture Document for Batch Data Ingestion and Transformation Pipeline

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the design and architecture of a batch data ingestion and processing system for a retail platform. The system ingests user event data and product metadata, transforms the data, performs aggregations, and stores the results for analytical use.

## 2. System Overview
The pipeline follows an Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) approach:

- **Extract**: Ingests daily user event and product metadata data.
- **Transform**: Cleans, enriches, and aggregates the data.
- **Load**: Stores the processed data in a scalable storage system for analytical use.

## 3. Architecture



### 3.1 High-Level Architecture
The pipeline consists of the following components:

- **Data Sources**: Simulated files stored locally or in cloud storage (S3, GCS).
- **Ingestion Engine**: Python-based scripts for reading and loading data.
- **Processing Layer**: Data cleaning, enrichment, and transformation using Pandas or PySpark.
- **Aggregation Engine**: Performs calculations for analytics.
- **Storage Layer**: Stores processed data in a structured format (CSV, JSON, Parquet, or a database).
- **Orchestration & Scheduling**: Uses Apache Airflow or cron jobs to automate execution.

### 3.2 Technology Stack

| Component            | Technology Choices              |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Data Storage**    | S3, Redshift                    |
| **Processing**      | Pandas                          |
| **Aggregation**     | Pandas                          |
| **Storage Format**  | CSV, Parquet, RDBMS             |
| **Orchestration**   | Apache Airflow                  |
| **Containerization**| Docker                          |

## 4. Data Ingestion

### 4.1 Data Sources
- **User Events**: Includes interactions like product views, purchases, wishlist additions.
- **Product Metadata**: Includes product name, price, stock levels, categories.

### 4.2 Data Ingestion Process
1. A script simulates data generation and stores it in a source location.
2. The ingestion script reads these files and loads them into the processing layer.

## 5. Data Transformation

### 5.1 Cleaning
- Remove records with missing fields.
- Convert incorrect data types.
- Standardize timestamp formats.

### 5.2 Enrichment
- Join user event data with product metadata to add product category and price.

### 5.3 Transformation
- Convert timestamps to a unified format.
- Normalize price fields to two decimal places.

## 6. Aggregations
- Total revenue per product category.
- Top 3 most-viewed products.
- Users with multiple purchases in a day.

## 7. Data Storage
- Incremental updates ensure only new data is processed.
- Store data in CSV, Parquet, or RDBMS (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or Apache Hudi/Iceberg for scalability).

## 8. Deployment & Orchestration

### 8.1 Dockerization
- Package the pipeline using Docker for easy deployment.
- Define a Dockerfile to containerize dependencies and scripts.

### 8.2 Scheduling
- Use Apache Airflow jobs to trigger the pipeline daily.

## 9. Conclusion
This design ensures a scalable, modular, and robust batch processing system for ingesting, transforming, and storing data for analytics. The pipeline can be extended to handle real-time data processing in the future.
